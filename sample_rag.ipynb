       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'sample.txt'}, page_content='Introduction to Data Science\\nData Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. Data science is closely related to the fields of data mining, machine learning, and big data. The key components of data science include data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization.\\n\\nData scientists use various tools such as Python, R, SQL, and cloud platforms to process large datasets and build models that help in decision-making. Popular libraries in Python used for data science include Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.\\n\\nKey Concepts in Machine Learning\\nMachine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning:\\n\\nSupervised Learning: In this type, the model is trained using labeled data. The goal is to map input to output based on the example input-output pairs.\\n\\nExample algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM).\\nUnsupervised Learning: In this type, the model is used to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data that is not labeled.\\n\\nExample algorithms: K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\\nReinforcement Learning: Here, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\\n\\nExample algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN).\\nIntroduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and LLaMA are advanced models trained on massive amounts of text data to generate human-like text based on input prompts. These models use transformer architecture and can perform various tasks, including question-answering, text generation, translation, summarization, and more.\\n\\nThe key advantage of LLMs is their ability to handle diverse tasks without needing task-specific training. They are pre-trained on vast corpora of text data and can be fine-tuned or used with techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to make their output more accurate and contextually relevant.\\n\\nVector Databases for Retrieval\\nIn the context of RAG, vector databases are used to store text as embeddings (vector representations). When a query is submitted, the system retrieves the most relevant embeddings based on similarity to the query, allowing the model to respond with the most pertinent information. Tools like FAISS, Pinecone, or Databricks Vector Search can be used for indexing and querying embeddings in a scalable manner.')]"

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'meditation.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='   Introduction   \\n Aft er reading and digesting the scholarly discussion on the myriad health \\nbenefi  ts attributed to meditation, it is quite tempting for the busy physician \\nto simply tell his patients that they “need to meditate. ” However, when that recommendation — no matter how sincere, well-meaning or intellectually appropriate — is given by a physician that has not himself learned to meditate, the recommendation becomes hollow, compared to the same recommenda-tion from a regular meditator. \\n Personal experience with meditation is required in order to accurately and \\nsincerely communicate the benefi  ts you expect an individual patient, with his \\nor her unique needs, to experience, and it is impossible to present that infor-mation with clarity unless you “know” how the practice of meditation has eff ected your own life and health. Once you can speak using the authority of \\npersonal experience as part of the basis for your “meditation prescription, ” as well as actually guide your patients as you provide specifi  c instructions on how \\nto meditate, it will be extremely hard for your patients not to pick up on the conviction behind your recommendations, making them far more likely to be implemented. Aft  er all, doesn’t every physician want his patients to follow his \\nadvice so they can achieve better health? Learning to meditate and starting a regular meditation practice are vitally important ways to improve the lives of patients and physicians alike. \\n Th e main objective of the meditative experience is to shift   the focus of the \\nmind away from the frenzied thoughts of everyday living, such as worries about work, family, fi  nances or simply the “to-do list” of the day. Th  ere are \\ncountless ways, or techniques, to do this.     \\n   What is Meditation?   \\n Meditation involves trying to train your thoughts to stay in the present moment, because in the present moment there is true peace. Th  oughts of the \\nfuture (what can/might/will happen, leading to fear or anxiety) or of the past (what did or might have happened, leading to sadness, depression, anger, or jealousy) prevent us from feeling the peace that is in the present moment. In other words, being totally focused in the present moment means that you do not think about the past or the future, and are freed (for as long as the medita-tion session lasts) from the negative emotions (stress) that accompany those \\nthoughts.    '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'meditation.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='   EXAMPLES OF MEDITATION      \\n      Can you think of an activity in which you totally lose track of time? • \\nWhen your attention is so focused that you say, “I don’t know where the time went?” Examples might be: painting or drawing, working in the garden, staring at the ocean, playing with your pet, journaling, teaching your child how to play a sport, dancing freely to your favor-ite music, etc. I found that when I was in the operating room perform-ing surgery, I was so focused that my operations became true meditations.        All of these situations are meditative experiences because there are no • \\nthoughts about the past or the future; the mind is thinking only of the present moment.        S o  a s  y o u  r e fl  ect on the experience(s) in your life where you lost track • \\nof time, you will realize that you also lost track of whatever was in your life that was causing you stress, whether it was a toxic relation-ship, a chronic illness, or the sadness that  comes with grief or loss.         \\n   CATEGORIES OF MEDITATION   \\n If you are lucky enough to have a hobby or some sort of activity in which you \\nengage on a daily basis and that makes you lose track of time, consider yourself \\none of the lucky people who have a regular meditation practice without know-ing it. However, the rest of us (the majority of people on the planet) need to create dedicated time in our schedule to engage in a formal activity to quiet the mind. As you can tell from the examples listed above, these experiences can be placed into three main categories:  \\n      C o n c e n t r a t i v e   • \\n      M o v e m e n t   • \\n      E x p r e s s i v e      • \\n Th ese three forms of meditation have been used for centuries in diff  erent \\ncultures and religious traditions. I will give examples of techniques for each category, and I suggest you experiment with them all so that you have enough experience to know what you like best (so it can become the start of your regu-lar meditation practice), as well as to know how to best explain them to your patients.      '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'meditation.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='   How to Meditate      \\n      First, scheduling time to meditate is of the utmost importance.  • \\n      We all lead busy lives and, despite the best of intentions, without a • \\ndedicated time for an activity, life oft  en gets in the way and the activ-\\nity never happens. (Th  ink of the diffi   culty most people have fi  nding \\nthe time to exercise unless they commit to a certain schedule.)        Th erefore, a meditation practice starts with fi  nding the time on a daily • \\nbasis. Th  e good news here is that not a lot of time is required.     \\n A beginner can start with just a few minutes a day, eventually getting to \\n20 to 30 minutes a day as the benefi  ts to the meditator become so obvious that \\nit becomes the most important part of his or her day.    \\n   CONCENTRATIVE TECHNIQUES      \\n       I will discuss concentrative techniques fi  rst, because • \\nthey are ones that are most oft  en described, taught \\nand practiced.         Th ey all involve active concentration, consciously • \\nfocusing the mind on something specifi  c. Examples \\nof this type of meditation include staring at the dance of a candle fl  ame, continuously repeating a \\nword to yourself (such as  peace  ,  love  or  God ) or \\nsimply following your breath. Th  e goal is to concentrate and try to \\nignore the other thoughts that will unfortunately pop into your head.  \\n      Th e secret is to allow those thoughts to come and to let them go by not • \\nallowing the mind to get caught up in them.        \\n   Tips for Applying the Concentrative Techniques      \\n       Don’t keep thinking of an unpleasant incident, start • \\ngetting worked up, begin feeling angry or hurt all over again and begin to plan your revenge. Th  at is  not  a \\nmeditative experience, but serves as an illustration of how a thought that arises, which is of a negative inci-dent, is given additional power by thoughts of the emotions associated with it (how you feel) as well as the thoughts of how to achieve retribution.  \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'meditation.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='      Instead of thinking that way, try your best to simply note that this is a • \\nthought that is occurring, and do your best to refocus your attention on the candle and not get stuck in the drama of the bad experience.

If you need proof of the usefulness of these techniques, just ask an • \\nexperienced meditator, who will likely be happy to share his or her success stories as well as the challenges that never fully go away.         \\n   Positioning      \\n       B e f o r e  s t a r t i n g ,  i t  i s  i m p o r t a n t  t o  p o s i t i o n  • \\nyourself properly, which means that you should be sitting comfortably, not lying down.

While this approach has neces-sitated making arbitrary classifi  cations and eliminating discussion of the spir-\\nitual aspects of a meditation practice, I know, through my own personal journey and professional experience, that practicing meditation in this reli-giously neutral, simple, and practical way has helped transform the lives of thousands of people. It is my fi  rm belief that those that wish to learn and expe-\\nrience the esoteric and spiritual benefi  ts of meditation will be led to, and will \\nfi nd, that which they sincerely seek.
